Others of you are paid similar salaries for similar things, and any of you who would be foolish as to write honest opinions would be out on the streets looking for another job. If I allowed my honest opinions to appear in one issue of my papers, before twenty-four hours my occupation would be gone.

Zelda let out a gentle laugh. \"Thanks. Well, you—\" \"The teachers are so strict that you're not even allowed to breathe!\" interrupted the King with a wicked grin. \"Huh?!\" \"Father!\" the princess exclaimed reproachfully. \"Sorry, go on.\" \"Now, Link—\" She was cut off by the bus horn this time. \"Oh, my bus must be around here now,\" said Link quickly, \"byes!\" \"Beware of the meat hash surprise!\" Gwonam seemed to have jumped out from nowhere. \"Hey, don't get shot!\" added the King, and both of them sniggered. Link was taken aback and looked highly upset for a moment, but Zelda was there to support him: \"Don't pay attention to 'em, Link. It's not that bad. I'm sure—\" \"Zelda, don't worry. I'll be fine.\" In an instant Link was back to being his beaming self. \"Alright. Give me a goodbye kiss.\" However, Link was of a different mind on this idea and replied snidely, with teenage cruelty, \"Hell no, screw that! I gave up on your royal ass years ago. I still love you though,\" added he as an afterthought before leaving the castle. \"Yeah, I don't know what she's worried about.
